### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I wasn't expecting guests but I'm glad you're here! 

Here's a few things you should know about me, as a heads up.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently going through the <strong>Odin Project</strong> (a full stack curriculum for web development, more info [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/))
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, going strong into React & nodeJS
- âš¡ I started my journey with Visual Basic for Applications, automating everything Excel and more. I was on a quest to automate every spreadsheet out there in the wild, before changing focus to web development (I had about ~5 .xlsx files left)
- :ok_hand: Programming languages are not the only ones I enjoy, as I speak Romanian, English, French fluently, with _some_ Spanish as well
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you feel like, but know I'm getting quite good at centering divs :smirk:
