### Hello! 

I wasn't expecting guests but you're more than welcome around here! 

Here's a few things you should know about me, as a heads up.

- Iâ€™m about to Finish the <strong>Odin Project</strong>, a full stack curriculum for web development (more info [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/))
- Iâ€™ve been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, going strong into React & Node.js 
- Throughout my learning process I've experimented with both SQL and NoSQL databases, from PostgreSQL to Firebase and MongoDB
- So far I've built 3 full-stack React apps, all currently in production (more info below)
- I've actually started my programing journey a few years back, using Visual Basic for Applications. I was on a quest to automate every spreadsheet out there in the wild, before changing focus to web development (I had about ~5 .xlsx files left)
- Programming languages are not the only ones I enjoy, as I speak Romanian, English and French fluently, with _some_ Spanish as well
- Ask me about anything you feel like, but just so you know, I'm really good at centering divs :smirk:

### :computer: Projects I've built 
### *<a href="[https://fitpowerup.com/](https://fitpowerup.com/)" target="_blank">fitPowerUp - A Dragon Ball Z Inspired Fitness App</a>*

fitPowerUp represents my first ever full-stack project. Built with React, Typescript and Firebase, I wanted to create an app that combined a wide array of features suitable for a fitness app, as well as a gamification element inspired from Dragon Ball Z series.
The app overview:
- It's a Progressive Web App
- I used Material UI as a components framework
- It handles authentication (via email and password & Google Sign In)
- Users can save workouts locally via IndexedDb and on the Firestore Db
- It provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard built with Recharts
- The user can export their own data to csv

Current monthly active users (outside of me): 2

### *<a href="[https://footballevolved.app/](https://footballevolved.app/)" target="_blank">Football Evolved - Tracker App For Amateur footballers</a>*

Had I had the talent, instead of becoming a developer I would have most likely become a professional footballer. Or maybe a professional footballer developer! 

In short, Football Evolved is my second full-stack app, and it represents an attempt to improve on all the mistakes I made while creating fitPowerUp. It's built with React and Firebase once again, and the app works as a tracker for amateur footballers. It combines utility with - you guessed it - a series of gamification elements.

The app overview:
- It's a Progressive Web App
- I used Chakra UI as a components framework (I wanted to learn something new other than Material UI)
- It handles authentication (via email and password & Google Sign In)
- Users can add their matches, together with a series of statistics (like goals scored, assists, fouls)
- It has a comprehensive highlights system, in case the user achieved specific events (like scoring a bycicle kick, etc.)
- Users can choose a club they support and upload their own images of the club
- AI coaches and AI journalists provide the user with feedback/analysis after matches, for improved imersion
- I'm using the OpenAI api
- Users can start challenges and competitions in order to win trophies, motivating themselves to perform at their best
- There is a social component, where users can search for the profiles of other users, and see their performances

Current monthly active users (outside of me): Let's say not a lot

### *<a href="[https://myfootballlegacy.com/](https://myfootballlegacy.com/)" target="_blank">My Football Legacy - A Football Management Simulator</a>*

After building two apps that worked but gained no users, I thought it was finally the moment to try and build something that other people would use. 

That's how My Football Legacy was born.

My Football Legacy is a football simulator app, allowing users to act as managers and simulate football seasons. I built this up with the objective of supporting a football community of series that was discontinued (Pro Evolution Soccer). 

A second goal was to discover a different approach to building apps, that's why I chose completely different technologies.

The app overview:
- It's a Progressive Web App
- It is built with Next.js and Supabase
- It uses Shadcn as a component library together with Tailwind
- I decided to start using React Query for state management (no more fetching through useEffect and using useContext).
- It handles server-side authentication via Next.js & Supabase auth
- Users can choose a league and team and start their season
- I recreated the structure of up-to-date competitions (all major leagues in Europe + Uefa Champions League and Europa League as well as cups)
- Users have an AI based management board that they can interact with through an email system
- It has a very comprehensive analytics dashboard, covering a series of KPIs related to football (still using Recharts)
- Users can perform player transfers, buying, selling and releasing players

Current monthly active users (outside of me): 270+
